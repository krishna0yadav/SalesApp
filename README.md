# SalesApp Its really awesome
This software provides a GUI for buying items and importing goods.
All the records are kept in a centralized environment on a PC.
Our project has a customer window, a list of items is provided for buying items, showing payable amount, produces a bill for the same.
Also, there is a vendor window for importing out-of-stock items from the list, shows total amount and keeps a record of imports in the database.
We can also access previous transaction bills with details.
